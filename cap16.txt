4 What steps will the user have to go through?

1.1 When someone wants to log in, we generate a unique secret token for them, store it
in the database linked to their email, and send it to them.
1.2 They then check their email, which will have a link to a URL that includes
that token.
1.3 When they click that link, we check whether the token exists in database,
and if so, they are logged in as the associated user.
